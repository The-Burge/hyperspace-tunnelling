The project is design to allow agent workers to view, assign and checkin passengers to starships.

It uses the following resources

- https://fakerapi.it/api/v2/persons for faking the passenger data
- https://robohash.org for randomly generating avatar images
- Local storage to save the state of passengers that require assigning and checking in
- https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction Toastify for notifications

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```
